# Notes

- Maybe a have spent a full day on this to fix to classic, just to found spiralofhope's fork. But I need this addon on Curse Forge, so I will keep this version. And try to keep it updated. (Specially on classic, cause I'm playing on retail right now)
- This addon is largely unchanged from hypehuman's spiralofhope's and  efforts!
- I am new to Lua and WoW addons at all, but I'll try my best to fix bugs and keep it up-to-date.
  -  If you are a developer, I am happy to:
     -  Accept GitHub pull requests.
     -  Add you as a contributor on GitHub.
     <!-- -  Hand this project over! -->
- There is basic compatibility with [LargerMacroIconSelection](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info11189-LargerMacroIconSelection.html)
  -  (just don't click it's `ok` at the bottom-right)



# Installation

Since it's a regular addon, it's manually installed the same as every other addon would be.

1) [Download Super Duper Macro](https://github.com/sergiooak/SuperDuperMacro/releases) 

2) Extract it to your `Interface\AddOns` folder.

Perhaps your game is installed to one of:

  `C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft` <br />
  `C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft (x86)` 

.. and so you would extract the contents of your downloaded archive to something like:

  `C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns` 

.. and so you would end up with the folder 

  `C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns\SuperDuperMacro`

.. and inside it would have `SuperDuperMacro.toc` and all the other files.

# Configuration / Usage

Open the interface by typing `/sdm`

- Create macros beyond the 255-character limit, and even beyond the 1023-character macrotext limit.
  -  However, no individual line in a macro may be more than 1023 characters long (you will get a warning).
  -  The number of lines is unlimited.
- Share macros in-game.
- Button macros
  -  36 global and 18 character-specific for each character.
- Floating macros are accessed with `/click` either at the chat box or within a macro.
  -  There is a `Usage` button which will explain how.
  -  You can make as many of these as you want.
- Lua scripts of unlimited length
  -  `/sdm run <name>`
  -  `sdm_RunScript("name")`
- NOTE:  World of Warcraft has a limitation where the macro's icon will not change if `#showtooltip` or the macro are long.
  -  SuperDuperMacro has not attempted to correct for this limit, so if you have a very long `#showtooltip` with many modifiers like `[mod:x]` or `[form:x`], your icon will not change.  You can still have a complex macro, but that `#showtooltip` will have to be made simple.



# Issues and suggestions

([issues list](https://github.com/sergiooak/SuperDuperMacro/issues))

- If you seen an error, disable all addons but this one and re-test before creating an issue.
  -  If you have multiple addons installed, errors you think are for one addon may actually be for another.  No really, disable everything else.
- Search for your issue before creating an issue.
- Always report errors.
  -  There are several helpful addons to catch errors.  Try something like [TekErr](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info6681).
